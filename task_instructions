Create a Laravel Web app which:

	- Allows user to login using Facebook JS API 
    (https://developers.facebook.com/docs/javascript/examples#login)

	- Once logged in user is shown an input and a 'Get Price' button. 
    User can enter a stock symbol (i.e. AMZN) into the input and when the button is clicked, 
    an AJAX call

			- calls an API on the Laravel app which in turn calls Alpha Vantage stock quote API 
            (https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#latestprice). 
            The API key to use is 0O18XUJW9P8QVGQJ
				For example 
                https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=GLOBAL_QUOTE&symbol=AMZN&apikey=0O18XUJW9P8QVGQJ will return the current information for Amazon (AMZN) stock price.

			- Stores the stock quote symbol, high, low and price in a database table and returns 
            all the information to the front end for the user to see. 
            Every quote retrieved is stored in the database.

	- Laravel app should allow the user to re-create the database table 
    (using Laravels database migrations)
